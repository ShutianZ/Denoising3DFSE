This work is the source code of our denoising work published in CIBM in 2022: Denoising of three-dimensional fast spin echo magnetic resonance images of knee joints using spatial-variant noise-relevant residual learning of convolution neural network. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2022.106295

The network structure of the proposed denoising CNN is shown in this figure. It could achieve an improvement in PSNR and SSIM by processing seperate 2-NEX MR images, compared to SOTA denoising CNNs with can only handle single-input.
